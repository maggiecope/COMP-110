Part 4: Put your analysis of the AI's stategy, based on viewing the contents of its
hats.

Based on the contents of the AI's hats, the AI's strategy is to take 3 sticks if the remaining amount 
of sticks is a variable of 4. Take 2 sticks if the remaining number of sicks is a variable of 3. Take a random stick if odd 
not a varaible of 3. And to take 1 stick if even and not a variable of 4 . 
This strategy works mathmatically as it makes it more likely that your opponent will end up with an odd number of sticks and 
eventually end up with the last stick, resulting in you winning.
